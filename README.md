Topic Modeling is an essential technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to uncover hidden themes or topics within a collection of text documents. This approach assigns topic labels to text by analyzing word patterns and frequencies, thereby revealing the underlying structure and relationships in the content.

The primary objective of topic modeling is to identify the key topics present in a large set of documents without requiring prior labeling. It is particularly useful for organizing, summarizing, and understanding vast amounts of unstructured text data.

In this project, I will be using LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for performing topic modeling.
This method analyze word distribution within the text corpus to determine the probability of each word belonging to a particular topic, allowing for the extraction of meaningful themes from the documents.

By applying topic modeling, we can effectively categorize and interpret text data, which is invaluable in various applications such as document clustering, information retrieval, recommendation systems, and sentiment analysis.
